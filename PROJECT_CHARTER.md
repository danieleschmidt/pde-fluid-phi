# PDE-Fluid-Φ Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: PDE-Fluid-Φ (N-Dimensional Neural Operators)  
**Project Start Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Expected Duration**: 24 months (Initial release in 12 months)  
**Project Manager**: Research Team Lead  
**Sponsor**: Terragon Labs  

## Problem Statement

Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods face fundamental limitations when simulating high Reynolds number turbulent flows:

1. **Computational Cost**: Extreme computational requirements (weeks/months on supercomputers)
2. **Numerical Instability**: Traditional methods struggle with chaotic, turbulent dynamics
3. **Scale Separation**: Difficulty capturing both large-scale flow and fine-scale turbulence
4. **Real-time Constraints**: Inability to provide real-time predictions for digital twins

Current neural operator approaches fail at Reynolds numbers above 10,000 due to spectral instability and energy accumulation at high frequencies.

## Project Vision

**Create the world's most stable and scalable neural operator framework for high-Reynolds number turbulent fluid dynamics, enabling real-time simulation of previously intractable problems.**

## Project Mission

Develop PDE-Fluid-Φ as an open-source framework that democratizes access to high-fidelity turbulence simulation through:
- Revolutionary Rational-Fourier Neural Operators

- 100x speedup over traditional CFD methods
- Seamless scaling from laptop to exascale systems
