# ADR-001: Rational-Fourier Operator Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) struggle with high Reynolds number turbulent flows due to:
- Numerical instability at high frequencies
- Energy accumulation in small scales
- Spectral aliasing effects
- Poor generalization to chaotic dynamics

Standard approaches using simple spectral convolutions fail to maintain stability for Re > 10,000 flows.

## Decision
Implement Rational-Fourier Neural Operators using learnable rational functions R(k) = P(k)/Q(k) in Fourier space, where:
- P(k) and Q(k) are learnable polynomials in wavenumber k
- Stability constraints enforce proper high-frequency decay
- Spectral regularization preserves physical properties

## Rationale
Rational functions provide:
1. **Stability Control**: Guaranteed decay R(k) → 0 as |k| → ∞
2. **Flexibility**: More expressive than simple polynomial filters  
3. **Physics Preservation**: Natural representation of fluid response functions
4. **Numerical Robustness**: Avoids high-frequency blow-up in chaotic systems

Alternatives considered:
- **Spectral Normalization**: Limited expressivity, doesn't address core instability
- **Adaptive Filtering**: Computationally expensive, requires online optimization
- **Residual Connections**: Helps but doesn't solve fundamental spectral issues

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Stable training on Re > 100,000 flows
- Spectral accuracy preservation
- Robust long-term predictions
- Natural physics interpretation

**Negative:**
- Increased parameter count (polynomial coefficients)
- More complex initialization procedures
- Additional regularization terms needed
- Potential for rational function singularities

## Implementation Notes
- Initialize polynomial coefficients to ensure stable rational functions
- Apply spectral radius constraints during training
- Use mixed precision to handle numerical precision issues
- Implement custom backward pass for rational multiplication
