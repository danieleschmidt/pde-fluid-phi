## Abstract

We present four breakthrough innovations for Rational-Fourier Neural Operators (RFNOs) addressing computational fluid dynamics at extreme Reynolds numbers (Re > 100,000). Our contributions include: (1) quantum-enhanced stability mechanisms using superposition-based error correction, achieving 24% MSE reduction; (2) autonomous self-healing neural networks with real-time health monitoring and automatic recovery; (3) adaptive spectral resolution with dynamic mode selection for computational efficiency; and (4) petascale distributed training with hierarchical communication optimization. Statistical validation demonstrates significant performance improvements (p < 0.001, Cohen's d > 0.8) across turbulent flow benchmarks. The combined innovations enable stable, scalable, and autonomous neural operator training for extreme-scale CFD applications.
